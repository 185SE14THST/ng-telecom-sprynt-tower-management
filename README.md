This repo contains the samples that demonstrate a 'communications tower asset management dashboard gui' for cell, telco and technicians. With further development the sample may show:
* Integration with Google Mpas or Open Street Maps.
* A list of styled asset data sets/tables with a SQL-backend called via REST API.
* A scoring algorithm for instant dispatch or technician email/notifications.
* Built in help desk ticketing system (or 3rd party integration where available).
* Importing assets using CSV files.
* Responsive design and mobile friendly.
